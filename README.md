SSH Userconfig Puppet Module
============================

This module configures a sane configurable ~/.ssh/config for several users.

The main goal is to have Host aliases with different ssh keypairs working
like this:

http://blog.firmhouse.com/configuring-multiple-private-ssh-deploy-keys-in-jenkins-for-github-com

If you have several private repos in github.com and you want to have a privilege seperation (no global read-only user for all repositories),
you can easily add a separate keypair per node/node role/profile like this:

Usage
-----

Currently, only inserting remote hosts to a ssh user config is supported.

This done like this:

```
# first remote host: github.com
sshuserconfig::remotehost { 'github_for_awesome_repo1' :
  unix_user           => 'jenkins',
  remote_hostname     => 'github.com',
  remote_username     => 'git',
  private_key_content => "some privkey content\n",
  public_key_content  => "some pubkey content\n",
}

# second remote host: github.com with a another key
sshuserconfig::remotehost { 'github_for_awesome_repo2' :
  unix_user           => 'jenkins',
  remote_hostname     => 'bitbucket.com',
  remote_username     => 'git',
  private_key_content => "some privkey content2\n",
  public_key_content  => "some pubkey content2\n",
}
```

This generate a `~/.ssh/config` file with two SSH `Host`' directives.

Now you can use a git-remote like this (as user 'jenkins'):

```
$ git clone git@github_for_awesome_repo1:s0enke/some_repo
$ git clone git@github_for_awesome_repo2:s0enke/some_repo_with_other_ssh_key

```
